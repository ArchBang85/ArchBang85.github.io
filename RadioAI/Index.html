<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Synopsis</h3>

<p>The mind critical for the maintenance of your habitat is failing, and though your capacity to communicate with a being so different is slight, you must try. By tuning into certain frequencies of thought in successive stages you may be able to reset the loop of self-consciousness. A game made for the radio box controller built by Petri Autio and Robin Baumgarten.</p>

<h3>
<a id="concept-note" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Concept</h3>

<p>
This game-artefact aims to combine simple gameplay with a fairly complex background, exploring a few themes in the process: dreams that heal, the importance philosophical understanding of selfhood, the nature of communication - in particular communicating with an uncommon mind with limited means - and hooking up the concrete with the abstract.
<br>
<br>
The conceit that motivated this project is that the habitat of the protagonist is homeostatically controlled by a long-ago established artificial intelligence which perhaps once was manipulable by the inhabitants of the protagonist's world but it is no longer so controllable, and which is unfortunately under some malaise which is gradually degrading the quality of the liveable environment. This pushes the protagonist to link up to the artificial mind with their limited technology, the radio box, and try and restore the mind to, what is from the biological protagonist's point-of-view, a better state. There is no reset button to the mind, but it is discovered that the mind is dreaming in some primordial state. The protagonist needs to enter into a "dialogue" with the mind to allow it to recall the cycle of thoughts it once used to undergo to understand its own nature as a free, self-aware being. The hope then is that a healthy mind leads to a healthy body (of the world).
<br>
<br>
This game draws from the philosophical tradition of German Idealism. See for example <a href="http://www.sunypress.edu/p-2136-hegels-theory-of-madness.aspx"> Hegel's Theory of Madness </a> or <a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/us/mythology-madness-and-laughter-9781441191052/"> Mythology, Madness and Laughter</a>.

<h3>
<a id="gameplay" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Gameplay</h3>

<p>
Gameplay is straightforward. The main dial plus the auxiliary dials of the controller adjust various dimensions of the kaleidoscope on the screen (colour, size, liveliness) which inform the player's position on a single frequency spectrum. Thought fragments of the AI mind are displayed as markov chain-generated text on the sides of the screen based on the location on this spectrum. The closer the player is to the generated sweet spots on the spectrum, the more coherent the statements are. The player must tune into the right coherence of statements and also the "right" (=adhering to a phenomenological narrative that purportedly props up self-consciousness) content of statements within a minute and then press a button to lock the frequency. Failure will revert to the previous level and success will take the player to the next level, which will reset the frequency targets, evolve the visual outlook of the kaleidoscope and draw statements from a new pool of raw text material.
<br>
<br>
The player wins the game when they have progressed through 5 levels. You can also set the game to tweet/save the resulting fragments of thought at the moment of submission. This helps motivate divergence from the normal success conditions an the seeking of "interesting" thoughts generated by program whether or not it leads to progress through the levels.

<h3>
<a id="About the Radio Box Controller" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About the Radio Box Controller</h3>
<p>The box controller was built as part of the Alt Ctrl Game Jam 2014 by Petri Autio and Robin Baumgarten, along with a game where you fly a zeppelin on Venus. The entry won the competition and has been exhibited at Berlin's Game Science Center and at Alt.Ctrl.GDC The controller is based on a retro aviator radio box found at a London car boot sale. All of the radio controls have been connecetd to an Arduino which has a bluetooth connection to a Nexus 7 embedded in the top portion, forming a self-contained game device.</p>
